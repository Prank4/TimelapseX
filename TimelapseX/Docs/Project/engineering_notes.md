# Engineering Notes — TimelapseX

## Purpose
Implementation notes and handoff history for the current project snapshot.

## Current Decisions
- iOS 26.0+ only.
- SwiftUI app with a two-tab shell: Camera and Settings.
- Exactly one active session exists at a time.
- Captures are stored locally first; Photos is only involved during Save and export flows.
- Lens changes automatically drop exposure, focus, and white balance locks back to continuous mode.

## Implementation Notes
- Keep capture sequencing per session, with numbering reset when a new session starts.
- Keep grid overlay UI-only so it never changes the saved JPEG output.
- Save should batch all frames into the session's Photos album in one atomic pass.
- Timelapse export should reuse the saved session's existing album instead of creating a second one.

## Handoff Notes
- Check that permission text and captions stay aligned with the deferred Photos authorization flow.
- Preserve the distinction between active, saved, and discarded sessions when wiring Gallery actions.
- Keep the project docs in sync with `MVP_SCOPE.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, and `TASKS.md` when scope changes.
